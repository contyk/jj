jj

jj is a simple FIFO and filesystem based Jabber/XMPP client. jj is inspired by
ii IRC client.

jj is more tool than traditional instant messanger client. It can be easily
extended with normal unix tools. It is perfect for bots and notifications.
Interaction with jj is done by writing and reading files from the server
directory which jj creates.

Quick getting started guide

To compile jj you need loudmouth and glib development libraries. On Debian
install these packages:

libloudmouth1-dev
libglib2.0-dev

Then you can compile jj with make:

make

Now you should have jj executable. Start it with the line (replace server and
user stuff with your own):

./jj -s server.tld -j user@server.tld -u user -p password -m User

It will create server.tld directory that will contain in file used to
communicate to jj and out file for the output. Commands recognize at this point
are:

/join channel@chat.server.tld
/msg username@server.tld

for every joined muc there will be a new directory in server.tld/mucs with its
own in and out files. Normal users will get a directory in server.tld directory
that works in the same way. After you have some mucs or users in server.tld you
can just write to in files and read the outfiles. Unix tool echo is nice way to
to write, example:

echo "/join chat@conference.jabber.org" > server.tld/in

Here is an example of the directory tree structure from connection to
server.tld.

server.tld
|-- in
|-- mucs
|   |-- lobby@conference.server.tld
|   |   |-- in
|   |   `-- out
|   |-- bar@conference.server.tld
|   |   |-- in
|   |   `-- out
|   |-- basement@conference.server.tld
|   |   |-- in
|   |   `-- out
|   `-- backstage@conference.server.tld
|       |-- in
|       `-- out
|-- out
`-- user@server.tld
    |-- in
    `-- out

Usage example

Here is a small usage example that shows basic usage. First start up jj. Then
join some mucs and finally follow mucs output with tail.

./jj -s server.tld -j user@server.tld -u user -p password -m User
echo "/join lobby@conference.server.tld" > server.tld/in
echo "/join bar@conference.server.tld" > server.tld/in
echo "/join basement@conference.server.tld" > server.tld/in
echo "/join backstage@conference.server.tld" > server.tld/in
cd server.tld/mucs
tail -f lobby@conference.server.tld/out bar@conference.server.tld/out basement@conference.server.tld/out backstage@conference.server.tld
